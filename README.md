# timed-quiz-utilizing-DOM-JS

## Description
For this project I created an timed quiz application.
The index.html page was created from scratch and had 3 different sections: 
    1) The first section was the start screen for the quiz. Once you clicked on the start quiz button it would take you to the quiz section.
    2) The second section was the quiz section with the questions. The quiz consisted of 5 questions and you had 60 seconds to answer them. If you got a question wrong your time was decremented by 5 seconds. If you got a question right your score increased by 100 points. 
    3) The third section was the end of quiz screen which showed your final score. Here you would entered you initials so that you could be added to the high score page. 

This was accomplished by: 
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing prompts, confirms, functions, arrays, for Loops, and a random number generater to pull indexes from the criteria arrays. I then pushed the random characters to the user's generated password array.</li>
    </ul>

## Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>DOM Manipulation</li>

</ul>

## What I Learned

While working on this project I learned how to use various JavaScript elements such as: object arrays, functions, and for Loops. The biggest learning moment was learning how to use the DOM to manipulate the html. That was no easy feat.
